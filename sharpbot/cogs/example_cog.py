#  import tags
#
#  Importing tags allows you to use the bot from other files.
#
#  Make sure your cogs are placed in the 'Cogs' Folder, or else it will not
#  be loaded.
#
#  To add changes to the bot, use the !restart command, it will re-load all
#  the code.
#
#
#  @tags.tag(" This is where you put your infomation about the command.")
#  def test_command(self):
#      self.message("Hello, this is a test.")
#
#
#    This will send the the message when you type !test_command to the bot in
#    messenger. Remember, the command is automatically added to the !commands
#    list.
#
#  You can also take the "client" instance into your own code, allowing you to
#  use the functionality of the fbchat module in your code.
